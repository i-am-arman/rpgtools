An amphisbaena winds its intricately-patterned sand-colored body sideways across the sand, each head leading by turn, leaving great twisting tracks in its wake as it seeks prey to sate its appetite. An amphisbaena attacks with two bites, one from each head. The bites are venomous, and a bitten victim must succeed in a saving throw versus Poison or die 1d4+2 turns later. On a successful bite, it also constricts the victim bitten for an additional 2d8 points of damage. Thereafter, constriction continues on subsequent rounds. A constricted character may break the amphisbaena's hold with a successful saving throw versus Paralysis; breaking the hold takes a full round during which no other actions can be made. An amphisbaena can simultaneously constrict two different creatures. Desert nomads consider the flesh of an amphisbaena a potent aphrodisiac (and it is a special component for philters of love), but obtaining it is a dangerous proposition.", descB:""},

An ankheg has six legs, and varies in shade from yellow to brown. It is about 10' long and weighs about 800 pounds. An ankheg burrows with legs and mandibles. A burrowing ankheg usually does not make a usable tunnel, but can construct one when necessary; it burrows at half speed when it does so. It often digs a winding tunnel up to 40 feet below the surface in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The tunnel is a tube, 5' in diameter, from 60' to 150' long ([1d10 + 5] x 10). An ankheg usually lies in its tunnel, 5' to 10' below the surface, until its antennae detect the approach of prey. It then burrows up to attack. Clusters of ankhegs share the same territory but do not cooperate. If an ankheg hits an opponent, it inflicts 3d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d4 points of damage from digestive acid excreted by its mandibles. The target must also save versus Paralysis or be grabbed. Grabbed victims are helpless until they escape by making a successful saving throw versus Paralysis on their turn. Once an ankheg has grabbed its prey, it will retreat down its tunnel at its burrow speed, dragging the victim with it. If the ankheg is damaged after grabbing its prey, it will retreat backward down its tunnel at its land speed (not its burrow speed). If desperate or frustrated, an ankheg can spit a 30-ft. line of acid for 4d8 points of damage (half damage on a successful saving throw versus Blast). One such attack depletes the ankheg's acid supply for 6 hours, so it will only spit acid when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or when it has not successfully grabbed an opponent.", descB:""},

Workers are about 6' long, while the queen may be immense. Giant ants eat almost anything, since they are omnivores, and will never retreat if defending the nest (Morale +4). They tend to have incidental treasure around their nests, left over from past opponents, but in some rare instances giant ants will inexplicably mine precious metals. This occurs in about 30% of nests, where there will be as much as 1d10x1000 gold pieces worth of raw gold nuggets.", descB:""},

As such, they have lost all pigment. White apes will vocalize and act aggressive if other creatures come near their lair, and may attack.

Although they may be mistaken for any giant spider, they are anything but unthinking. Sly, patient, and intelligent, the arane weave plots as deftly as they weave a web, and often work with others of their kind, surrounding themselves with frightened minions or others of a similarly wicked nature. These crafty beings spin webs in strategic locations around their lairs, and may also spray webbing at victims to capture them or keep them fresh for later consumption. These swift bursts of webbing may be done 3 times per day, and can be flung to a range of 30', covering a 10'-diameter area. All targets in the area must make a saving throw versus Blast or suffer effects identical to the web spell, however the web does not dissolve and cannot be dispelled. The bite of an arane is venomous, and a victim will die in 1d4 turns unless a saving throw versus Poison is made. 20% of arane cast spells as Witches of a level equal to their HD.

The tongue is set with a hollow tip of sharp bone, and reattached with its base inside the mouth rather than down the throat; this, gives the blood hound a piercing tongue attack that it can use in close quarters.

In combat, blood hounds claw with ragged, filthy, bone-like talons, and lash with their piercing tongue, although they sometimes attempt to wrap their tongue around an opponent's leg and drag them down to the ground, instead (see Knockdown, ACKS p. 109). This trip requires the victim to make a saving throw versus Paralysis to remain standing and disentangle.

This innate elemental power makes dragons the longest lived of all beasts. Dragons can live for over a thousand years, growing in size and power with every passing century. But whatever their age, all dragons are completely carnivorous, egg-laying monsters forever inscrutable to the minds of men. All true dragons belong to the same race of creatures and can inter-breed. Nevertheless, dragons come in an astounding variety of shapes, colors, and powers. Due to their connection to the elements, dragons come to reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats over time, and can be grouped into general categories on this basis. A dragon’s Armor Class, Hit Dice, breath weapon, and other abilities depend on a combination of the dragon’s age and habitat. Dragons are able to produce a powerful attack with a breath weapon. Though the classic breath weapon is the fire from a 'fire-breathing dragon,' different dragons breathe different kinds of effects. All dragons’ breath weapons deal 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the dragon and are usable 3 times per day. Unless the situation prevents it, dragons will tend to use their breath weapon as their initial attack when confronted with combat. Dragons will use their breath weapons about 50% of the time on all subsequent rounds of combat. When the breath weapon is not employed, they will attack with two claws and a bite attack. A dragon’s breath weapon can have one of three potential shapes: cloud shaped, cone shaped, and line shaped. All cloudshaped breath effects occupy an area that is 20' high, 40' long, and 40' wide. Cone-shaped effects begin with a width of 2', and spread out into a cone shape 90' long and 30' wide. Line shaped breath weapons have the same 5' width for their entire lengths (100'). All creatures within the area of effect will take full damage from the breath unless they make a saving throw versus Breath. Success indicates that the creature takes only half damage. Dragons are immune to the effects of their own breath weapon, as well as the same kind of breath weapon from other dragons. They are further immune to ordinary instances of a similar nature to their attack. For instance, a red dragon is immune to all ordinary fire and the fire breath of all other dragons. However, dragons will sustain half damage from magical based attacks that are similar to the nature of their breath weapons. A blue dragon, for instance, will not suffer damage from a natural lightning strike, but will suffer half damage from spell lightning bolt.",descB:""},

Draugr have swollen blue flesh and reek of decay, but are possessed of great strength and supernatural power. Like all undead, they are immune to poison and charm, hold, and sleep spells. Further, electricity and cold do only half damage, and they are unaffected by normal weapons.

Draugr exposed to sunlight must make a saving throw v. Paralysis each round or be rendered helpless. Draugr have the ability to use each of the following spell-like abilities three times per day:bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse), cause disease (the reverse of cure disease), cause fear (the reverse of remove fear), darkness (the reverse of light), faerie fire, passwall, and skinchange into a cat, flayed bull, horse, or seal. Draugr with 9 hit dice (or more) can use the following additional abilities once per week:divination, and summon weather. All draugr have the ability to take gaseous form at will. Reducing a draugr to zero hit points does not destroy the creature; it merely forces the draugr into its gaseous form on its next action. Any additional damage dealt to a draugr forced into gaseous form has no effect. A gaseous draugr will reform with full hit points after resting in its barrow for 8 hours. If a draugr is slain in its barrow and its head immediately cut off, this will prevent it from entering gaseous form for 8 hours. If its body is then burnt and its ashes scattered in a lake, river, or ocean, the draugr is fully destroyed. Sometimes draugr will equip themselves with weapons and shields selected from the grave goods in their barrows. Increase the draugr's AC by the value of any armor or shield equipped. Draugr armed with weapons have one attack per round, dealing double damage by weapon. A draugr's weapons and armor are left behind if it assumes gaseous form.

Naturally, Faravahar coloring tends to bronze and gunmetal; rarely intruding into copper and silver. They tend to dye their feathers any number of gemstone hues, and often have some affectation towards certain patterns. Faravahar of rank clad themselves in light silk stoles, dropping just below the waist, usually clipped to feather roots for control during flight.

They favor open, airy architecture that blends in with the surrounding area - from a distance, their settlements may be taken as interestingly complex natural formations. They will often set up labyrinthine tunnels for storage or as a defensive measure - as the Faravahar can climb with their strong hind claws, these tunnels often run vertically. Male and female Faravahar are equally capable in combat. Up to 2d3 eggs and young may be found in a Faravahar settlement - they reproduce rarely, and a new child is a cause for years-long celebration.

Always depicted as a dark-skinned human with a scarab beetle as a head, the Khepri is believed to have been a god, an avatar of one of the Chthonic deities. The truth is more terrifying:The khepri was not a god; they were a race, the dominant race in AurÃ«pos in the era before man, their dark rule contested only by their eternal foes, the faravahar (see p. 170). Few khepri survived the devastation of the Day Without Night. Most of the survivors slumber in hidden vaults in remote places. The few khepri that have been roused to action have been great and malevolent actors in AurÃ«posean history, often serving as prophets and teachers of Chthonic beliefs in order to lay the groundwork for the Awakening. Khepri hegemony was founded on the race's mental powers. All khepri have the ability to use each of the following spell-like abilities at will:body equilibrium (like water walking, but extending to all loose or unstable surfaces, such as sand), clairaudience, clairvoyance, choking grip, detect invisible, levitate, shimmer, and telepathy. Khepri can also charm monster once per day. The legend of the beetle-headed god arises from the alien appearance of the creatures. A khepri's torso and limbs resemble those of a tall and muscular jet-black humanoid, but its head is protected by a smooth, shiny black carapace. A crown of chitin extends from the brow of this carapace, while three three long mandibular appendages extend like legs from either side of it, the whole resembling a beetle's body. But it is not. The front portion of the khepri's carapace consists of segmented plates that can be opened to reveal an utterly inhuman face within, upon which countless khepri larvae squirm and writhe. Any character seeing a khepri's true face must save versus Paralysis or be paralyzed by fear until the khepri goes out of sight, closes its face plate, or attacks. In lieu of a melee attack, a khepri can \"kiss\" an adjacent paralyzed victim. The khepri's larvae leap onto the helpless victim's face, burrow into his skull via his mouth, nose, and ears, and make their way to his brain. One round after being kissed, the victim must make a saving throw versus Poison. If the saving throw fails, the victim dies from shock. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim survives but is enslaved (as the spell) by the khepri. The larvae can be destroyed (before or after the saving throw) by casting a cure disease spell on the victim. Destroying the larvae frees an enslaved victim, but does not revive a slain one. An enslaved victim is also freed if the khepri who kissed him is slain. If the larvae are not destroyed, they will grow inside the victim, feeding on his essence. After 2d4 weeks, the character will slip into a state of unconsciousness, during which the engorged larvae will weave a cocoon around his head. 72 hours later, the victim will awaken to his new life as one of the khepri. Once the character has fallen unconscious, no magic can save him except a wish or miracle. Death is usually the kinder alternative. Khepri are usually solitary creatures, but from time to time hapless adventurers will stumble upon one of the ancient vaults the khepri built to survive the Day Without Night. A khepri vault will be led by a hierarch with 11 (or more) Hit Dice. Khepri hierarchs (9000 XP) can use the following additional abilities:phantasmal killer, scry (with clairaudience and ESP), strength of mind, and weakness of mind once per day; alter self and dimension door three times per day; and telekinesis at will. They are also capable of brewing potions, creating constructs, creating crossbreeds, and performing necromancy as a mage of their HD, and can collect divine power and perform blood sacrifices as a chaotic cleric of their HD.

Such was their power that primitive man worshiped them as gods and served them as slaves. Yet from this height, the Thrassian people fell to abyssal lows. Some taint in the Thrassian bloodline caused them to slowly degenerate into primitive savagery. Had they been kinder to their subject peoples, the Thrassians might have slipped into obscurity peacefully. Instead they were violently overthrown by the Zaharans, who seized power from their former masters and formed their own dark empire. Of the handful of Thrassians that survived the Zaharan uprising, most fled to the outlying swamps and jungles, where they continued their devolution to the primitive lizardmen of today. The few true Thrassians that presently exist are slaves sorcerously bred for the amusement of Kemeshi nobles. Other civilized lands remember the Thrassians only from aged histories, and look on their degenerate ancestors with contempt as brutes. The time of the Thrassians has passed. Or has it? The lizardmen claim it is yet to come. Their scaly shamans teach that the greatest of the Thrassian priest-kings escaped the wrath of the Zaharans, and even now slumbers in a hidden vault; and that when he awakens, he shall stride forth with a legion of Thrassian warriors and lead his children to restore the empire of old. The sages deem this a fable, merely the lizardmen's version of the Chthonic myth of the Awakening. If it were true, however, and one of the Thrassian tyrants of old did return, then the shores of the Ammas AurÃ« would become an abattoir, as the Thrassians avenged a thousand years of humiliation with blood and slaughter. Thrassians stand 7' to 8' tall, resembling massive lizardmen with large heads characterized by prominent and protruding fangs and glowing yellow eyes that grant 120' infravision. Dragon-like wings erupt from their shoulder blades, giving them crude flight capabilities. They typically fight with bites and claws, but sometimes wield weapons, favoring tridents (pole arms) for battlefield formations and javelins for aerial skirmishing. Their immense strength grants them a +3 bonus to damage with weapons. They typically wear partial leather or hide armor atop their thick, scaly hides. Thrassians are the natural leaders of lizardmen, and are rarely encountered without a substantial force of followers and servants. A Thrassian has a 75% chance to be guarded by 1d8 lizardman champions and 5d8 lizardman warriors. A Thrassian has a 10% chance of either Priest or Mage abilities at level 4. Thrassian Priests are worth 215 XP each, while Thrassian Mages are worth 280 XP each. When Thrassians are encountered in a dominion, there will be 1d8 lizardmen champions and 5d8 lizardman warriors serving each Thrassian. The Thrassians and their lizardmen followers will collectively be led by a Thrassian dominator with AC 9, 8+1 Hit Dice, and 40 hit points, dealing +2 damage with natural attacks or +4 damage with weapons. A dominator has either Priest (75%) or Mage (25%) abilities at level 8. A dominator may possess magic items in addition to any held by the dominion.

Mummy lords are dreadful to behold, and any character seeing one must save versus Paralysis or be paralyzed by fear until the mummy lord goes out of sight or attacks. In melee, a hit by a mummy lord does 1d12 points of damage and inflicts the creature struck with mummy rot. The tomb of a mummy lord is always well-appointed with grave goods, and if the monster was a warrior in life, its weapons and armor may be available for the mummy lord's use. If armored, increase the mummy lord's AC by the value of any armor or shield equipped. If armed, mummy lords deal damage by weapon, adding +4 to the damage roll due to their great strength (plus any fighter damage bonus, where appropriate). A mummy lord's malignancy extends into whatever weapon it wields, so characters will still be infected by mummy rot if struck by an armed mummy lord. The evil rituals used to create mummy lords imbue the monsters with the ability to bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) and charm person at will. Once per day they may summon an insect plague and once per week they may summon weather. Mummy lords can only be damaged by spells, fire, or magic weapons, all of which only do half damage. They are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. Mummy lords are turned as vampires, but may make a saving throw versus Spells to ignore the effects of being turned. When a mummy lord is reduced to zero hit points (or otherwise physically destroyed), its disembodied spirit returns to the canopic jar containing its organs, while its body instantly breaks apart into an insect swarm. The swarm will be 30' x 30' in size, centered on the point where the mummy lord's body was destroyed. The swarm immediately inflicts 2 points of damage to any character engulfed. Double damage is dealt to characters wearing no armor. The swarm cannot be damaged, but disperses after one combat round. The insects will converge on the mummy lord's tomb 1d10 nights later, where they re-form the mummy lord's body.

There these treasures were to remain, sealed within until the bleak re-birth of the dead as foretold by the Zaharan Deathspeakers and Eunuch-Priests. As in every land and every time, the lure and lay of this buried wealth proved too great for the greedy, the foolhardy, the heedless, the desperate, and the foolish to resist. A frightful fate awaited those caught trespassing in the tombs of the Zaharans - transformation into a nathaghol. The grisly punishment, laid down by the followers of Kaleth and Ravanor, only bolstered the grim reputation of Zahar as a wellspring of malice, cruelty, and sadistic cunning. The nathaghol, sometimes called glintersnatches in the common tongue of the Auran Empire, linger to this day in crumbling vaults and lost, forsaken places. Sentenced to deathlessness for their crimes of avarice against Zahar, these warped aberrations now use the greed of ages to lure others into death. At one time a nathaghol was humanoid, but now it is nothing near. A lidless, eyeless face sniffs vainly in the darkness, with flensed flesh peeled back from its gaping mouth and nose. A now-distended jaw allows for the unnatural feeding of coins and jewels into the creature's blackened, snaggle-toothed maw. Flayed and oozing skin hugs tightly to cracked and oddly angled bones that creak and whine even as the abomination shuffles along in a hunched, awkward, unnatural gate. A wheezing, unholy breath resembling the sound of shifting coins in an overfull sack sounds balefully when the monster becomes excited or exerts itself. Nathaghol possess a dreadful strength and an awful cunning, and these creatures can climb walls, hide in shadows, and move silently as 7th level thieves. They can cast locate object at will, but only to locate coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items. Nathaghol hunger for coins, gems, jewelry, and magical items. Oftentimes they suckle, chew, and swallow such items they happen upon, which then work their way euphorically yet painfully through the nathaghol's body in 1d4 turns, dropping beneath them as it passes through. If they ingest a gem, piece of jewelry, or small magical item, they regenerate 3 hit points per round for as long as the item works through its body. A nathaghol can only 'see' or 'smell' beings carrying wealth - coins, gems, jewelry, or magical items. Someone who carries no such precious metals is invisible and typically irrelevant to this creature. Note that even silver thread or a gold button will be sniffed out by the nathaghol and rouse its unnatural hunger. Once per day the nathaghol may spend a round to physically tear open its own belly to retrieve a previously swallowed bit of treasure. The coin, gem, or jewel is then placed in a desired location or hurled at a victim. A living creature within 60' who gazes upon a treasure retrieved in this way must save versus Spells or be overcome with a dire curse:A selfish, cruel, and ravenous desire to possess the cursed wealth overcomes them, and the greed-ridden target will engage in scheming, fighting and killing all others while vying for the cursed treasure. An affected creature with no living (or remaining) rivals for the cursed treasure will then swallow it - ingesting the cursed wealth causes 6d6 points of damage as it turns to acid in their belly and is destroyed. Additionally, the first time in a day a nathaghol is struck by a slashing weapon in combat, 1d6 cursed pieces of treasure fall from its body, forcing a number of saving throws equal to the number of coins falling from the wound in a jingling clatter. A nathaghol's treasure remains cursed and dangerous from the time it leaves their body until the rising of the next dawn.

Once a person becomes a vampire, he or she is a chaotic undead creature. Reducing a vampire to zero hit points does not destroy the creature; it merely forces the vampire into its gaseous form. A gaseous vampire will reform with full hit points after resting in its coffin for 8 hours. Even if all its coffins are broken, the vampire will not be destroyed, though it will not able to reform until a minion builds a new coffin for it. There are only a few means by which a vampire may be truly destroyed. First, vampires may be killed in 1 turn by immersion in running water. Second, if caught in sunlight, a vampire will be completely turned to dust unless it succeeds in a saving throw versus Death each round it suffers exposure. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire. If a vampire is staked without decapitation, he will appear to die, but he will be able to revive if the stake is removed. Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or other humanoids of all life energy. A character slain by a vampire will return from death as a vampire after 3 days. He will be a slave to the vampire that created him, but becomes free willed if the master is killed.", descB:""},
